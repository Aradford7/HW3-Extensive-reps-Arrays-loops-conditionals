//EASY GOING
//1. Write a loop that will log the numbers1 through 20.

/*for(let i=1; i<=20; i++){
    console.log('The number is' + i);}*/
//"Commit 1 - Easy Going answered"

//GET EVEN
//2. Write a for loop that will log only the even numbers 
//in 0 through 200.

/*for(i = 0; i < 200; i++){
    if ((i % 2) == 0){
        console.log('This number is' + i)
    }
} */
//"Commit 2 - Get Even answered"

//EXCITED KITTEN
//3.Write code that logs "Love me, pet me! HSSSSSS!" 20 times.
//4.For every even number in your loop, log "...human...why 
//you taking pictures of me?...", "...the catnip made me do it...",
// or "...why does the red dot always get away..." at random.

//Hint: You will need to use Math.random()
